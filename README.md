## üõ† Setting Up Prisma & MongoDB

This project uses **Prisma** as the ORM and **MongoDB** as the database.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Configure MongoDB**
If you haven't installed MongoDB, follow the official [MongoDB Installation Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).

Once installed, start the MongoDB service:
```bash
mongod --dbpath /data/db
```

Or if using **Docker**:
```bash
docker run --name mongodb -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Prisma**
After installing dependencies, initialize Prisma:
```bash
npx prisma init
```

This will generate a `.env` file and a `prisma/schema.prisma` file. Open `.env` and set up your MongoDB connection string:
```env
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/workflow"
```

Or if using a remote MongoDB service:
```env
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/workflow?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Migrate Database Schema**
Run the following command to push the schema to MongoDB:
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

To open the Prisma Studio GUI for database management:
```bash
npx prisma studio
```

---

## üöÄ Deployment

To run the application in **production mode**, use the following command:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

If using Docker:
```bash
docker build -t workflow .
docker run -p 3000:3000 workflow
```

---

## üì¶ Docker Setup

For easier deployment and scalability, you can use Docker to containerize this application.

### **Dockerfile**
Create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory with the following content:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install --production

# Copy the rest of the application files
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### **Docker Compose**
For multi-container setup, create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  workflow:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    restart: always

  mongodb:
    image: mongo
    container_name: mongodb
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongodb_data:/data/db
    restart: always

volumes:
  mongodb_data:
```

### **Running with Docker Compose**
To start the application using Docker Compose, run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the application:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
